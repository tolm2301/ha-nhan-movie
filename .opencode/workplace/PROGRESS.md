# Progress Timeline

## YYYY-MM-DD
- Scope: Review UI and crawled data flow optimization.
- Actions: Created task board entry; sent designer review context; started evidence trail.
- Evidence: Current flow uses `src/lib/movies.json` for hero + category buckets in `src/lib/data.js`; UI renders hero + five carousel sections from static filters.
- Verification: Designer check complete: UI is readable and mobile-aware, but the data flow is not fully optimized because the hero client component pulls the whole JSON bundle.
- Verification: Developer check complete: production build passes; lint fails on pre-existing unescaped quotes in `src/app/search/SearchContent.jsx` and warns on `<img>` usage in hero/card components.
- Notes: Crawl script completed and refreshed `src/lib/movies.json`, but reported undefined errors for some targets. Final review complete; task closed with known risks.

## 2026-04-21
- Scope: Coordinate follow-up on category crawl quality, wrong playback routing, tiny player sizing, YouTube control visibility, and full-vs-series episode rules.
- Acceptance criteria: category crawls exclude low-quality/incorrect videos; each card opens its own detail/playback target; movie player is readable and usable; YouTube controls are hidden/configured per spec; full movies do not show episode lists; series still do.
- Actions: Opened a new high-priority in-progress task and assigned the sequence designer -> developer -> creator -> techlead review.
- Evidence: User report lists the exact regressions; existing board/handoff records now reflect the new task chain.
- Verification: Pending developer build/lint/runtime validation and final techlead review.
- Risks: Content metadata may be insufficient to classify quality/type cleanly; routing and player behavior may share the same component path.
